#### **1. Abstract**

The aim of this study was to determine which, if any acts as an
effective treatment for PTSD. The study divided 150 patients (M= 75,
F=75) into 3 groups using random sampling dependent on the type of
treatment they would receive; Control (traditional CBT, no VR), Static
(non-animated model content, VR), Animated (animated model content, VR).
Treatment consisted of a 50 minute session weekly with a therapist over
12 weeks. PTSD measurements for all groups were measured using the
observer-rated and self-report mechanisms. Findings concluded that
patients OR and CPSS-SR measurement were significantly decreased post
treatment. Graph 1a shows that the OR and CPSS-SR measurements are very
closely related. Furthermore the report suggests there is no leading
therapy for PTSD.

#### **2.Introduction**

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is observed in humans that have
been exposed to a horrifying event, through direct experience or witness
of such event. Symptoms might include vivid flashbacks, nightmares,
intense distress and severe anxiety (Mayo Clinic, n.d.). Evidently this
mental health issue can be very distressing for those affected.
Therapies utilized were; Control (traditional Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (CBT), no Virtual Reality (VR)), Static (non-animated model
content, VR), Animated (animated model content, VR). Traditional CBT
involves the therapist and patient working through current day issues.
They will navigate through the patients thoughts, emotions and behaviors
together (HSE, 2022). The rationale behind this study is to understand
what the most effective treatment is for PTSD in young adults. The null
hypothesis states that the treatments will have no effect. The
alternative hypothesis states that all treatments would be effective.

#### **3.Method**

150 patients (aged 18-25) enrolled in the study was conducted over 12
weeks (1st August 2022 - 23rd of October 2022). The patients (M= 75,
F=75) into 3 equal groups using random sampling dependent on the type of
treatment they would receive; Control (traditional CBT, no VR), Static
(non-animated model content, VR), Animated (animated model content, VR).
The three groups underwent therapy with the same therapists to ensure
that all patients results are comparable. Similarly each patient was
treated for 50 minutes, once a week across the 12 weeks. The study aims
to determine the most effective treatment for PTSD through statistical
analysis such as histograms, standard deviation, the T test and box
plots. PTSD measurements for all groups were measured using the
observer-rated (therapist score) and self-report (self-score). These
values assess the extremity of PTSD symptoms in said patient (Foa,
1993). Measurements were taken at the start and end of the study. It was
this data was used for determining effectiveness of PTSD treatments.

#### **5.Discussion**

The sum of pre-trial and post-trail OR and CPSS-SR were compared in
figure 1a, which indicates that there is no leading therapy. Figures 1b,
1c and 1d shows that our data collected from each treatment is normally
distributed. This suggests that if a patient is treated with the
described treatments, their OR and cPSS-SR measurements will decrease
post treatment. Figure 1e displays the 95% confidence interval for the
population of Static, Control and Animated. Figure 1f compares the
difference between the mean of the Antimated and Control group results.
There is a negative correlation between level of treatment received by
patient (explanatory variable) and the OR and CPSS-SR measurement
(response variable). In conclusion the results reject the null
hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis. Although there
appears to be no leading treatment for PTSD patients, traditional CBT,
non-animated model content, and animated model content prove to be
successful therapies.
